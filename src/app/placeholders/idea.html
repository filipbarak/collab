        <p class="ml-3 mb-3">This is Adel’s I2 template for Idea Incubation. The following sections are offered as
            guidance to help the Innovator communicate their idea to the community members. Any member can add new
            sections as appropriate.
            The purpose of this document is to create a public document that will be posted as a marketing promotion of
            the idea. This will reside on the Adel homepage (adel.io), as well as other locations utilized by Adel.
            No confidential or sensitive information will reside in this document. Any sensitive details will be moved
            to the P2 Project Planning document by the Community Administrators, or the Project Review Committee, once
            that phase is activated.
            I2 helps promote Adel’s incubation initiative, and helps bring new members to the community. New members
            bring more expertise, more passion, and more entrepreneurs, to help incubate blockchain projects that will
            change the world.
