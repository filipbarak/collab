        <p class="ml-3 mb-3">This is Adel’s P2 template for Project Planning. It is a confidential document for selected
            members of the community (i.e. a Group), or it may be available to the entire community. This document is
            now active because the idea has graduated the business planning stage, and is now designated as a “Project”.
            The following sections are offered as guidance to help members formulate and debate the business planning
            details of the project. Members can add new sections as appropriate. The purpose of this document is to
            finalize a confidential document that will be used to activate the project. When the project moves to
            activation stage it is called E2, or Enterprise Execution.
            P2 is a very important initiative, because it serves to minimize mistakes and maximize the project’s
            potential. Therefore, please work as a collective team to populate this business plan to the best of your
            ability.
